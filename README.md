- **Real-time Updates**: Risk assessment refreshes on all status changes

#### **Weighted Risk Scoring Algorithm - Deep Dive**

**Why This Algorithm?**
The weighted risk scoring algorithm was chosen over simpler alternatives (like basic cancellation rate) because it provides:

1. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Considers 5 key behavioral factors instead of just one
2. **Adaptive Scoring**: Weights can be adjusted based on business needs
3. **Nuanced Assessment**: Distinguishes between different types of problematic behavior
4. **Scalable**: Works for businesses of any size
5. **Actionable**: Provides clear risk levels for decision-making

**Algorithm Formula:**
```
Risk Score = (CancellationRate × 0.30) + 
             (NoShowRate × 0.25) + 
             (LastMinuteCancelRate × 0.20) + 
             (ConsecutiveCancellations × 0.15) + 
             (BookingFrequency × 0.10)
```

**Factor Breakdown:**

| Factor | Weight | Purpose | Calculation |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Cancellation Rate** | 30% | Primary reliability indicator | `cancelled_bookings / total_bookings` |
| **No-Show Rate** | 25% | Measures commitment level | `no_show_bookings / total_bookings` |
| **Last-Minute Cancels** | 20% | Indicates poor planning | `last_minute_cancels / cancelled_bookings` |
| **Consecutive Cancels** | 15% | Shows pattern behavior | `max_consecutive_cancellations × 20` |
| **Booking Frequency** | 10% | Indicates engagement level | Normalized based on booking intervals |

**Risk Level Thresholds:**
- **🟢 Low Risk (0-19)**: Reliable customers, no restrictions
- **🟡 Medium Risk (20-39)**: Monitor closely, optional restrictions
- **🟠 High Risk (40-59)**: Require approval, consider deposits
- **🔴 Very High Risk (60-100)**: Full payment required, manual approval

#### **Benefits Over Alternative Approaches:**

**vs. Simple Cancellation Rate:**
- ✅ Considers timing patterns (last-minute vs planned cancellations)
- ✅ Accounts for booking frequency and engagement
- ✅ Identifies consecutive cancellation patterns
- ❌ Simple rate only shows overall percentage

**vs. Machine Learning Models:**
- ✅ Transparent and explainable scoring
- ✅ No training data required
- ✅ Easy to adjust weights for business needs
- ✅ Fast computation and real-time updates
- ❌ ML models require large datasets and complex training

**vs. Rule-Based Systems:**
- ✅ Continuous scoring instead of binary decisions
- ✅ Considers multiple factors simultaneously
- ✅ Graduated risk levels for flexible responses
- ❌ Rule-based systems are rigid and hard to adjust

#### **Business Impact:**

**Revenue Protection:**
- **Deposit Requirements**: High-risk customers pay upfront
- **Approval Workflow**: Prevents problematic bookings
- **Advance Booking Limits**: Reduces last-minute cancellations

**Operational Efficiency:**
- **Proactive Management**: Identify issues before they happen
- **Resource Planning**: Better staff allocation based on reliability
- **Admin Visibility**: Clear dashboard for monitoring customer behavior

**Customer Experience:**
- **Fair Treatment**: Risk-based restrictions are transparent
- **Reliable Service**: Reduces no-shows for other customers
- **Personalized Approach**: Different rules based on behavior

#### **Real-World Example:**
```
Customer: Sarah Johnson
Total Bookings: 15
Completed: 8 (53%)
Cancelled: 7 (47%)
No-Shows: 3 (20%)
Last-Minute Cancels: 4 (57% of cancellations)
Consecutive Cancels: 3
Average Booking Frequency: 14 days

Risk Calculation:
- Cancellation Rate: 47% × 30 = 14.1
- No-Show Rate: 20% × 25 = 5.0
- Last-Minute Rate: 57% × 20 = 11.4
- Consecutive Cancels: 3 × 15 = 4.5
- Booking Frequency: 14 days × 10 = 1.4

Total Risk Score: 36.4 (Medium Risk)
Recommendation: Monitor closely, consider 48-hour cancellation notice
```

#### **Admin Dashboard Features:**
- **Risk Overview**: Statistics and distribution charts
- **Customer List**: Detailed risk metrics for each customer
- **Search & Filter**: Find specific customers quickly
- **Admin Notes**: Add behavioral observations

#### **Integration Points:**
- **Booking Flow**: Real-time risk checking during appointment booking
- **Email System**: Risk-based email templates and notifications
- **Appointment Management**: Automatic risk updates on status changes
- **Admin Notifications**: Alerts for high-risk booking attempts

#### **Automatic Operation:**
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box without setup

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Server Actions vs API Routes
**For future development, prefer Server Actions over API Routes when possible:**

- **Use Server Actions for**: Data mutations, form submissions, server-side operations
- **Use API Routes for**: External integrations, webhooks, third-party API calls
- **Benefits of Server Actions**: Better TypeScript support, automatic revalidation, simpler error handling

**Example Server Action:**
```typescript
// src/lib/actions/appointments.ts
'use server';

export async function updateAppointmentStatus(appointmentId: string, status: string) {
  // Server-side logic here
  revalidatePath('/admin/appointments');
  return { success: true };
}
```

**Current Implementation**: Existing API routes are maintained for compatibility. New features should use Server Actions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- pnpm package manager
- MongoDB database
- Resend API key (for emails)
- Stripe account (for payments - optional)

### Environment Variables
See [ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md](./ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md) for detailed configuration instructions.

**Required:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - MongoDB connection string
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - For email notifications
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Application URL

**Optional:**
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - For payment processing
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` - For authentication

### Local Development & Email Testing

**Yes, you can test emails from localhost!** Here's how:

1. **Set up your `.env.local` file** with your Resend API key
2. **Run the development server**: `pnpm dev`
3. **Book an appointment** on `http://localhost:3000`
4. **Check email queue** at `http://localhost:3000/admin/emails`
5. **Process emails** using the "Process Queue" button

**Email testing works locally because:**
- Resend API works from any domain (localhost or production)
- Your verified domain `emails.ariflab.xyz` works from anywhere
- No need to deploy to test email functionality

### Risk Assessment Testing

**The Risk Assessment System Works Automatically! 🎉**

**No initialization required** - risk assessments are created automatically when:
- Customers book appointments
- Admins view the risk dashboard
- Any risk-related API is called

**Test the Customer Risk Assessment System:**

1. **Access Admin Dashboard**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin/risk-assessment`
   - View risk statistics and customer list
   - Test search and filtering functionality

2. **Test Booking Restrictions**:
   - Create test customer accounts
   - Book and cancel appointments to build risk history
   - Try booking again to see risk warnings
   - Test approval workflow for high-risk customers

3. **Test Admin Functions**:
   - Add admin notes to customers
   - Refresh risk assessments manually
   - View detailed risk metrics and recommendations

4. **Test Risk Integration**:
   - Book appointments and watch risk scores update
   - Cancel appointments to see risk increase
   - Check that restrictions are enforced in booking flow

**Optional: Pre-populate Risk Data** (for existing customers):
```bash
pnpm risk:init
```
*This is only needed if you want to create risk assessments for customers who already have appointments but no risk data yet.*

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd service-sync
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in your environment variables
```

4. **Set up the database**
```bash
pnpm db:push
pnpm db:generate
```

5. **Run the development server**
```bash
pnpm dev
```
